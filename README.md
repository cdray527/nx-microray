![project overview](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/406b7f67-8c0c-474c-8c37-2ad5bc1f4976/image.jpeg)

This proof-of-concept project designed to demonstrate the potential of a scalable web application in microservices architecture, each services are containerized using Docker. The key services include:

- **Frontend**: Microfrontend approach using Nx Workspace and Module Federation
- **Backend**: GraphQL server built with Golang
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API Gateway**: Nginx

## Benefits of Microservices

- **Scalable**: Scale individual services independently or add new service based on demand.
- **Flexible**: Each service can be develop using own choices of languages or framework that best suited for.
- **Faster development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously or independently.
- **Maintainable**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to manage and debug.
- **Reusable**: Share services across multiple projects to reduce redundancy.
- **Isolation**: Faults in one service donâ€™t impact the entire system, making failures easier to track and handle.
- **Continuous delivery**: Independent pipelines enable faster updates.

## Setup 

1. Install Docker on your machine.

2. Clone all submodules
